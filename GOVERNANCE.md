# Project Governance

The Valkey project is managed by a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) composed of the maintainers of main Valkey repository.
The Valkey project includes all of the repositories under the Valkey-io github organization, which includes the main Valkey repository and supporting repositories.
Maintainers are defined as individuals with full commit access to the Valkey repository.
Maintainers of supporting repositories within the Valkey project are not members of the TSC.

## Technical Steering Committee

The TSC will be responsible for oversight of all technical, project, approval, and policy matters for Valkey.

The TSC members are listed in the MAINTAINERS.md file in the main Valkey repository.
New maintainers (and accordingly, TSC members) may be added or removed by no less than 2/3 affirmative vote of the current TSC.
The TSC will appoint a Chair responsible for organizing TSC meetings.
If the TSC Chair is removed from the Committee (or the Chair steps down from that role), it is the responsibility of the TSC to appoint a new Chair.
The TSC can choose to amend this governance document by no less than a 2/3 affirmative vote.

The TSC may, at its discretion, add or remove members who are not maintainers of the main Valkey repository.
The TSC may, at its discretion, add or remove maintainers from supporting repositories within the Valkey project.

## Voting

The TSC will strive for all decisions to be made by consensus.
While explicit agreement of the entire TSC is preferred, it is not required for consensus.
Rather, the TSC will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the TSC and nature of support and objections. 
The TSC will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements.
If consensus cannot be reached, the TSC will make the decision by a vote.

The TSC Chair will call a vote with reasonable notice to the TSC, setting out a discussion period and a separate voting period.
Any discussion may be conducted in person or electronically by text, voice, or video.
The discussion will be open to the public, with the notable exception of discussions involving embargoed security issues or the addition or removal of maintainers, which will be private.
In any vote, each voting maintainer will have one vote. 
Except as specifically noted elsewhere in this document, decisions by vote require a simple majority vote of all voting members.

## Termination of Membership

A maintainerâ€™s access (and accordingly, their position on the TSC) will be removed if any of the following occur:

* Resignation: Written notice of resignation to the TSC.
* TSC Vote: 2/3 affirmative vote of the TSC to remove a member
* Unreachable Member: If a member is unresponsive for more than six months, the remaining active members of the TSC may vote to remove to unreachable member by simple majority.

## Technical direction for supporting projects

The TSC may delegate decision making for supporting projects within the Valkey project to a Supporting Steering Committees (SSC).
An SSC will be determined by the MAINTAINERS.md file in the repository for the supporting project.
The initial membership of the SSC will be determined by the TSC.
Once created, the SSC will take over responsibility for the technical decision making and maintenance of their supporting project.
The SSC will be required to adopt its own governance document, outside of the requirements set forth in this document.

The TSC may, at its discretion, overule the decision of any of the SSC with a normal vote.
